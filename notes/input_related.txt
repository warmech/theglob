																			   
================================= PLAYER INPUT =================================

I had initially assumed that, sine the game was writing the status of player 
input to $7D62, that the game was reading that address in memory to determine 
what action to take (move, jump, etc.). After realizing that it would probably 
make more sense to just poll the inputs at port $02 and perform bitwise 
operations on them, I went on assuming this would simply be the case. While I 
was experimenting in RAM, I decided to play with that address and, lo and 
behold, the game reads that address and performs bitwise operations on it to 
determine what to do with Toby. All that to say:

Player input is read from port $02 into $7D62 and bitwise operations are 
performed on that location in memory to determine what action to have Toby 
perform.
